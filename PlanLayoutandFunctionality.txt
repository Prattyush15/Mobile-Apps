Utilize the same code from the instagram project inorder to create the rotating images. Then create a bottom bar which allows you to switch between post account and feed. 
When you click post, it will allow you to post a picture and when you click feed, it will show you your feed
The screen should show the values the user is inputting
State values should hold the images from the feed and the new inputted images
It will be the same as the instagram project but with a bottom bar with the ability to swtichbetween post accoutn and feed.
